## REQUIREMENTS:
### ‚óè	System - Windows 7 or higher, 1 GB RAM.

## PROCEDURE:
### For X-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select X-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to X-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Y-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Y-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Y-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Z-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Z-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Z-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## For Complete-Axis Assembly
###   1.	Select Complete-Axis Assembly from the visible list.
###   2.	All the parts related to Complete-Axis will be shown on the screen.
###   3.	Select the parts in sequence in which they are shown.
###   4.	When the first part is selected then it will open in the blank space in the left side of the screen.
###   5.	Further, when the correct part will be selected then it will get assembled with the previously selected part/parts.
###   6.	If the user follows an incorrect sequence then a pop-up will appear on the screen showing the name of the part to be selected.

## Playing with Axes
###   1.	Move the x-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the x-axis assembly.
###   2.	Move the y-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the y-axis assembly.
###   3.	Move the z-axis slider or enter the value (within the given range) in the given text box and press/select ENTER. Now observe the movement of the z-axis assembly.
